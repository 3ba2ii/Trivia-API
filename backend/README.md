# Trivia API Documentation

## üëãüèª Introduction 
Trivia API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, Our API retrieves, deletes, adds questions and get questions based on categories and returns them as JSON responses.
## üé¨ Getting Started

### Base URL 
This API only runs locally so the base URL is ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/```
### Installing Dependencies

##### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

##### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#####  PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

#####   Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend micro-services framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Database Setup

With Postgres running, restore a database using the ```trivia.psql``` file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
###### Development Mode
```bash
dropdb trivia && createdb trivia
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```
###### Testing Mode
```bash
dropdb trivia_test && createdb trivia_tes
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

## üöÄ Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
